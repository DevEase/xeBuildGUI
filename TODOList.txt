Implement furhter CPUKey checks in the validator for that
Design the advanced settings tab
Design the console information tab
Design these tools:
	- NAND Extractor (Extract data from NAND's)
	- SMC Config Editor (Edit SMC Config information)
	- x360NANDManager stuff (Read/Write NAND hardware + flash chips maybe also post monitoring...)
	- UART Monitoring (Maybe...)
	- Dashlaunch configuration tool (Might throw this one in the bin)
Design these xeBuild GUI Editors:
	- SMC Patchset editor
	- Target kernel editor
	- Target type editor
	- Motherboard editor
	- Optional patches editor (info about the patches)
Implement further settings shit
Implement dealing with commandline args (such as drag 'n' drop a nand dump)
Implement further CPUKey checks (cpukey validation, part of x360Utils connections)
Implement all of the xeBuild args generation stuff
Implement x360NANDManager connections
Implement x360Utils connections
Implement drag 'n' drop support for NANDS
